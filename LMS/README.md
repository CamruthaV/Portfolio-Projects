Title: Developing a Library Management System with Servlet/JSP-JDBC and Deployment

Background:
XYZ Library, a bustling hub for knowledge seekers, sought to modernize its operations by introducing a digital system for managing its extensive collection of books and resources. The library envisioned a web-based solution to facilitate tasks such as book borrowing, return management, inventory tracking, and user management. After careful consideration, they opted to develop the system using Java Servlets and JSP for the frontend, JDBC for seamless database connectivity, and deploy it on an Apache Tomcat server.

Objective:
To create a comprehensive web application utilizing Java Servlets, JSP, and JDBC technologies for building an efficient Library Management System. The system aims to streamline operations, enhance user experience, and ensure effective management of library resources.

Functionalities:
Designing an intuitive user interface for seamless library resource management.
Implementing secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Establishing a robust database schema for storing books, users, transactions, and related information.
Ensuring seamless integration between Servlets, JSP, and JDBC for efficient data processing.
Deploying the application on an Apache Tomcat server and optimizing its configuration for optimalÂ performance.
